# Advance-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, we utilize machine learning to analyze the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset, aiming to predict a movie's genre and release year from its plot summary. This endeavor bridges data science with cinematic storytelling, leveraging a dataset that spans a wide range of genres and a century's worth of films.

Our approach combines natural language processing and advanced machine learning techniques, employing TensorFlow and a Transformer-based model. Key to our methodology is preprocessing the data to address challenges like data imbalance and the diversity in genre classifications.

The project focuses on optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning and employing rigorous evaluation metrics. Our goal is to demonstrate the use of machine learning in the field of natural language processing, specifically within entertainment analytics, to provide insights into categorizing content and discerning historical trends in cinema.
